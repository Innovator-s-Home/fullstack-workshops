### How to use this code :

#### You can **download code** in 2 ways  :

1. **Git Commands**
   - create an project folder `mkdir <project_folder_name>` 
   - use `git clone <repository_url>`
   - navigate the specific root directory you want to work with
   - run `npm install` inside the root directory before running the code

  

2. If you are not comfortable with git, directly **download the branch as Zip**.
   - navigate the specific root directory you want to work with
   - run `npm install` inside the root directory before running the code
